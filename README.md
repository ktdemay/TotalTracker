# TotalTracker
# About
Total Tracker is an all in one program created to help NBA bettors track how their bets are doing in real time. Data is pulled from ESPN's API and updated on the site every 30 seconds. The listed Over/Under is the based on the latest odds up until the start of the game. The projected total is calculated based on how many points have been scored and how much time is left in the game. You can mark your bets in the 'Notes' column and compare your bets to the projected total to see how you're looking in real time.
